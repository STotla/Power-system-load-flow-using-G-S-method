# Power-system-load-flow-using-G-S-method
load flow study of n bus system using Gauss-Seidel Method in MATLAB
 These programs are for load flow of n bus power system
 this repository consist of four files: main program, YBUS,busdata6,lineData6
 keep all the file in same directory 
 Add bus data in busdata6 file, accurately
 add line data in linedata6 file accurately
 Then run your main file.
 information of each steps use in the code is mentiones in comments in the program files.
